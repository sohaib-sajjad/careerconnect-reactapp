## Project Overview
**Career Connect** is a full-stack job board web application developed as part of CA2 for the B9IS123 module.  
The application connects **organizations** and **job seekers**, allowing organizations to post jobs and users to discover and apply for suitable opportunities.

The project demonstrates practical skills in **web application development**, **client–server architecture**, **database integration**, and **deployment**, while maintaining individuality beyond generic systems such as student or employee management systems.

## Live Deployment Links

- **Frontend (React App – Netlify):**  
   https://careerconnectca2.netlify.app/

- **Backend (Node.js / TypeScript API – Render):**  
   https://careerconnect-serverapp.onrender.com/

> The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs hosted on Render.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Deployed on **Netlify**

### Backend
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- Deployed on **Render**

### Database
- MongoDB (NoSQL)
- Mongoose ODM

---

## Architecture
The application follows a **client–server architecture**:
- The React frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs
- The backend handles business logic, authentication, and database operations
- MongoDB is used to store users, organizations, jobs, and applications

---

## Deployment
- **Frontend:** Netlify  
- **Backend:** Render  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  

The deployed system provides a fully working version of the application, satisfying the requirement to deliver a functional project with a database collection before adding additional features.

---

## Development Process
- All development was tracked using **Git**
- Features were implemented incrementally
- Version control was consistently used to manage changes and improvements

---

## Use of AI Tools
AI tools such as **ChatGPT** were used responsibly for:
- Assistance with HTML/CSS styling
- Debugging and fixing code issues
- Clarifying implementation approaches

All design decisions, logic implementation, and integration were performed and validated by the developer.

---

## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- Full-stack web development skills
- Use of TypeScript in a Node.js backend
- REST API design and consumption
- Database design using MongoDB
- Cloud deployment and environment configuration
- Practical application of programming concepts taught in the module
